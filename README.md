CS51 Final Project of Victor Alvarez and Nick Brinkmann.

To run the file :

- compile via `make all` in the terminal.
- run `./run.byte`.
- the graphics window is pretty self-explanatory. Click on pieces to select them;
then click on the square you want to move to. If you cannot move to a square, it 
is likely either
a) not your turn or
b) not a legal move.
- at the end of the game, you can click `take back` to get back to the original 
starting position, or `exit` to close the window.
